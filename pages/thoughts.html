        <h5>The reality distortion field</h5>
        <p>
        In 1965, Gordon Moore — one of the co-founders of Intel — made a bold observation coined as Moore’s Law. Moore’s Law states that the number of transistors per square inch in an integrated circuit will approximately double every two years, implying that computing power will exponentially increase with time. As of 2017, this prediction has been <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/transistors-per-microprocessor?yScale=linear" target="_blank">eerily accurate</a> (although this trend will <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlmwGQXNVRs" target="_blank">not continue indefinitely</a>). 
        <br><br>
        In the midst of the Cold War, a space race between the USSR and the US emerged in full force. The world watched as the two dominant forces at play made efforts to conquer the frontier of space. On March 25th, 1961, <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/moondec.html" target="_blank">President John F. Kennedy made a bold promise </a>to the American people that they would land on the moon by the end of the decade. On July 20th, 1969, Neil Armstrong was the first of mankind to set foot on the lunar mass, ultimately resulting in USSR to concede.

        In Walter Isaacson’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Steve-Jobs-Walter-Isaacson/dp/1501127624" target="_blank">Steve Jobs</a>, details and stories were provided which outlined a phenomenon Steve’s colleagues referred to as the reality distortion field. Andy Hertzfield, the lead designer of the Macintosh project, stated that it was Steve Jobs’ uncanny ability to convince both himself and others around him, to believe almost anything with a mix of charm, charisma, bravado, hyperbole, marketing, appeasement, and persistence. He willed products and features into existence by distorting his co-workers’ sense of perception of what is possible.
        <br><br>
        Would computing power be as abundant as it is today in the absence of Moore's Law? Would we have beaten Russia to the moon in the absence of JFK's promise? Would the Apple products we use today exist in the absence of Steve Jobs? My takeaway from this is simple - sometimes what we need is a visionary; someone who has the conviction that the seemingly impossible can be accomplished.
