        <h4>About Me</h4>
        <p> 
          I grew up in Vancouver and studied Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo. The co-op program at Waterloo gave me the unique opportunity to intern at exceptional companies including Apple, LinkedIn, and Uber. I’ll soon begin the next chapter of my life, where I will be moving to San Francisco to join the Search Platform team at LinkedIn.
          </br></br>
          I’m a perpetual learner — I firmly believe that if I am not learning, then I must take corrective action to make changes in my life. I’m also an optimist by nature and believe that virtually any problem can be deconstructed and solved through the collective hard work and brainpower of people.  
        </p>
        <h4>Motivation</h4>
        <p>
          During my teenage years, society sharply transitioned into an increasingly digital lifestyle. Platforms such as Facebook and Twitter acted as a virtual playground for millenials around the globe with access to the Internet. These platforms allowed me, as well as my peers, to propagate opinions, beliefs, and interests to the rest of the world in the click of a button. However, as time passed, the consumption patterns of these platforms drastically changed among my demographic. These platforms no longer provide a safe space for honest opinions and earnest debates. One of the main motivations for the creation of this website is to fill this void. I also think that it would be of value — mostly for my future self — to virtualize some of my thoughts, beliefs, and personal research on topics I take deep interest in.
